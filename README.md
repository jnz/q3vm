Q3VM Readme
===========

A lightweight (single file: `vm.c`) embeddable interpreter/Virtual Machine (VM) for compiled bytecode files (`.qvm`) based on good old C-language input (`.c`). A complete C compiler to generate `.qvm` files is included (LCC). The interpreter is based on the Quake III Arena virtual machine (hence the name q3vm) but the interpreter is not tied to Quake III Arena and can be used for any kind of project. For example code that needs to run in a sandbox.

Read the excellent introduction to the Q3VM by Fabien Sanglard:

 * http://fabiensanglard.net/quake3/qvm.php

Features
--------

 * Small and lightweight (one .c file to include without dependencies)
 * Battle-tested (20 years of use in Quake III Arena)
 * VM and LCC forked from the well maintained ioquake3 code base
 * Tool tested (static code analysis, test coverage, Valgrind)
 * No need to learn a new scripting language (e.g. Lua)
 * Static type checking in the language (C)
 * Static memory allocation in C, no unpredictable garbage collector
 * Plan B: you can always go back to native code, as .c files are the input
 * Great tool landscape for C. Use the tools that are available for C
 * Computed gotos are used to speed up the interpreter if you compile with GCC (see benchmark section)

Use Cases
---------

 * Sandbox for code you don't fully trust (e.g. download the bytecode from a web server)
 * Mods for hobby game engines
 * There are many virtual machines, but not many are so small, with strong typing and no garbage collector
 * Learn about virtual machines in general, but directly have a C compiler available for the virtual machine
 * Sandbox for embedded applications, e.g. plug-ins for IoT applications on microcontrollers (bounded CPU time, bounded memory area, restrict access to peripheral devices)
 * There is also a historical value: learn about the Quake III engine

Original comments by John Carmack
---------------------------------

John Carmack's .plan for Nov 03, 1998:

*I had been working under the assumption that Java was the right way to go, but recently I reached a better conclusion.*
*The programming language for QuakeArena mods is interpreted ANSI C. (well, I am dropping the double data type, but otherwise it should be pretty conformant)*
*The game will have an interpreter for a virtual RISC-like CPU. This should have a minor speed benefit over a byte-coded, stack based java interpreter. Loads and stores are confined to a preset block of memory, and access to all external system facilities is done with system traps to the main game code, so it is completely secure.*
*The tools necessary for building mods will all be freely available: a modified version of LCC and a new program called q3asm. LCC is a wonderful project - a cross platform, cross compiling ANSI C compiler done in under 20K lines of code. Anyone interested in compilers should pick up a copy of "A retargetable C compiler: design and implementation" by Fraser and Hanson.*
*You can't link against any libraries, so every function must be resolved. Things like strcmp, memcpy, rand, etc. must all be implemented directly. I have code for all the ones I use, but some people may have to modify their coding styles or provide implementations for other functions.*
*It is a fair amount of work to restructure all the interfaces to not share pointers between the system and the games, but it is a whole lot easier than porting everything to a new language. The client game code is about 10k lines, and the server game code is about 20k lines.*
*The drawback is performance. It will probably perform somewhat like QC. Most of the heavy lifting is still done in the builtin functions for path tracing and world sampling, but you could still hurt yourself by looping over tons of objects every frame. Yes, this does mean more load on servers, but I am making some improvements in other parts that I hope will balance things to about the way Q2 was on previous generation hardware.*
*There is also the amusing avenue of writing hand tuned virtual assembly assembly language for critical functions.*
*I think this is The Right Thing.*


Quick Intro
-----------

Two things are required:

 * The interpreter
 * A bytecode binary .qvm file

Run:

    > q3vm.exe bytecode.qvm

The q3vm.exe standalone interpreter is not required, it is more of a demo
application.  You can easily add the interpreter as a single .c file to your
project (`vm.c` and the header `vm.h`).  Call `VM_Create` and `VM_Call` to run
the bytecode in your application:

    #include "vm.h"

    vm_t vm;
    int result;
    
    VM_Create(&vm, "my test", pointerToByteCodeBuffer, sysCall);
    result = VM_Call(&vm, 12345);
    VM_Free(&vm);
    
The `pointerToByteCodeBuffer` is some memory location where the bytecode is
located. You can e.g. load it from a file and store it in a byte array. See
`main.c` for an example implementation.

Data can be exchanged with the bytecode by the return value (result) and
arguments to `VM_Call`. Here just a 12345 is passed to the bytecode. It is up
to the `vmMain` function in the bytecode what to do with that value.  You can pass
more (up to 12) optional arguments to the bytecode:
e.g. `VM_Call(&vm, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)`.

The `sysCall` is a callback function that you define so that the interpreter
can call native functions from your code. E.g. a logging function or some time
critical function that you don't want to implement in the bytecode. Again,
check `main.c` for an example. Also check the section *How to add a custom
native function* for more information.

A few callback functions are required, read the section *Callback functions
required in host application* for more information.

And normally you should also check if `VM_Create` returns 0 (i.e. everything is
OK).

Folder structure
----------------

    │  ├─ linux/        Linux target folder for LCC compiler and q3asm linker
    │  └─ win32/        Precompiled lcc.exe and q3asm.exe for Windows

    │  └─ vm/           The core VM source, copy that folder into your project
    └─ test/            Test environment

API Documentation
-----------------

Call `make doxygen` to autogenerate the API documentation in the `doxygen/html`
directory. Doxygen is required as well as the dot command (part of graphviz).
Install it with `sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz` on Debian or Ubuntu.

    > make doxygen

But you can also read `vm.h` directly for the API documentation.


Build VM/interpreter
--------------------

On **Linux**:

    > make

On **Windows**:

Use the **Visual Studio 2015** project `q3vm.sln` in the `msvc` subfolder.

Or install MinGW64 and add the MinGW64 bin\ directory to your path.
So that you have gcc.exe and mingw32-make.exe available at the command prompt.

 * http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/download/mingw-builds

Compile with:

    > mingw32-make

Build example bytecode firmware
-------------------------------

**Windows**:

The LCC compiler (lcc.exe) is included in the ./bin/win32 directory.
You need make (mingw32-make) from the MinGW64 installation in
your path. The Makefile calls LCC and q3asm to generate `bytecode.qvm`:

    cd example
    mingw32-make

If you don't want to use make, you can do the steps from the make file
manually at the command line. Compile every `.c` source code with `LCC`:

    > lcc -S -Wf-target=bytecode -Wf-g YOUR_C_CODE.c

This will create .asm output files. Then link the .asm files with `q3asm` (based on a bytecode.q3asm
linker script):

    > q3asm -f bytecode

The output of q3asm is a `.qvm` file that you can run with q3vm.


**Linux**:

Build LCC:

    > make lcc

Build q3asm

    > make q3asm

Build the example bytecode:

    > make example/bytecode.qvm

Callback functions required in host application
-----------------------------------------------

**malloc and free**:

The following functions are required in the host application for
memory allocation:

    void* Com_malloc(size_t size, vm_t* vm, vmMallocType_t type);
    {
        (void)vm;
        (void)type;
        return malloc(size);
    }
    
    void Com_free(void* p, vm_t* vm, vmMallocType_t type)
    {
        (void)vm;
        (void)type;
        free(p);
    }

The host can simply call `malloc` and `free` or use a custom memory allocation
function or use static memory (e.g. in an embedded application). Each VM only
calls `Com_malloc` once per malloc type. This can be used as a help for the static memory
allocation in an embedded environment without malloc() and free().

**Error handling**:

The following function needs to be implemented in the host application:

    void Com_Error(vmErrorCode_t level, const char* error)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "Err (%i): %s\n", level, error);
        exit(level);
    }

The error id is given by the `vmErrorCode_t` parameter. The `error` string describes
what went wrong.  It is up to the host application how to deal with the error.
In this simple example we just print the error string and exit the application.
The error code is stored in the `vm_t::lastError` variable.

How to add a custom native function
-----------------------------------

Let's say we want to add a native function to convert a string to an integer:
`stringToInt`.  We want to add the function to our virtual machine (step 1) and
call it from our example code (step 2).  (Note: there is already the atoi function in
the bytecode, but this is just an example on how to call `atoi` as a native
function and deal with address translation).


**Step 1)** Add the native function to the host application

Open `src/main.c` and modify the `systemCalls` function. Add `case -5:` for the
new native function. We just use the next free id (here -5) as an identifier.
The identifier will be important in step 2.  The first argument
for `stringToInt` is the address of a string. The address is in the virtual
machine address space, so we can't directly use that argument (`args[1]`) for
the native call to `atoi`. There is a helper macro that will translate the
address for use: `VMA`. We need to give `VMA` the pointer argument from the
bytecode and the virtual machine context (`vm`) to translate it.
The function `VM_MemoryRangeValid` makes sure that the memory range is valid. This is e.g.
important for the memcpy call, so that the VM cannot write outside of
the sandbox memory.


    /* Call native functions from the bytecode: */
    intptr_t systemCalls(vm_t* vm, intptr_t* args)
    {
        const int id = -1 - args[0];
    
        switch (id)
        {
        case -1: /* PRINTF */
            return printf("%s", (const char*)VMA(1, vm));

        case -2: /* ERROR */
            return fprintf(stderr, "%s", (const char*)VMA(1, vm));
    
        case -3: /* MEMSET */
            if (VM_MemoryRangeValid(args[1]/*addr*/, args[3]/*len*/, vm) == 0)
            {
                memset(VMA(1, vm), args[2], args[3]);
            }
            return args[1];
    
        case -4: /* MEMCPY */
            if (VM_MemoryRangeValid(args[1]/*addr*/, args[3]/*len*/, vm) == 0 &&
                VM_MemoryRangeValid(args[2]/*addr*/, args[3]/*len*/, vm) == 0)
            {
                memcpy(VMA(1, vm), VMA(2, vm), args[3]);
            }
            return args[1];
    
        case -5: /* stringToInt */                             // < NEW
            return atoi(VMA(1, vm));                           // < NEW
    
        default:
            fprintf(stderr, "Bad system call: %ld", (long int)args[0]);
        }
        return 0;
    }

**Step 2)** Tell the bytecode about this function

Now we need to tell our example project about this new function `strintToInt`.
Open `example/g_syscalls.asm` and add the last line. The identifier -5 is
important for the mapping.

    code
    
    equ	trap_Printf				-1
    equ	trap_Error				-2
    equ	memset					-3
    equ	memcpy					-4
    equ	stringToInt				-5

**Step 3)** Perform an example call to `strintToInt`

Edit `example/main.c` and add the function declaration:

    int stringToInt(const char* a);

And call it somewhere from the `vmMain` function:

    char* myStr = "1234";
    printf("\"%s\" -> %i\n", myStr, stringToInt(myStr));

Compile everything:

    > make && make example/bytecode.qvm

And run it:

    > ./q3vm example/bytecode.qvm


Static code analysis
--------------------

Call `make analysis` and `make valgrind` to check the VM with:

 * clang static code analysis (scan-build)
 * cppcheck
 * Valgrind

clang-format
------------

Run the following command to reformat a file according to the coding style:

    > clang-format -i -style=file input.c


Debugging
---------

Build `vm.c` with `#define DEBUG_VM` in `vm.h` to enable more checks and debug
functions. Call `VM_Debug()` to enable debug printfs.  This
requires the symbol file of the `.qvm`: the `.map` file in the same directory
as the `.qvm`. The `.map` file is automatically generated for each `.qvm`.

Call at the end of a session `VM_VmProfile_f(vm)` to see a VM usage summary.
